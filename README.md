## Meal planner

[mealplanner.rawpotion.io](https://mealplanner.rawpotion.io)

Rawpotion meal planner is the ideal meal plan scheduler.

Angular is used as the primary language for the frontend/client, and Firebase acts as the backend/server. 

### Installation

To get stated simply clone the repository, and run `yarn`

Make sure an environment.ts file is in `src/app/environments`.

An optional, but recommended step is using firebase emulator for local development.

`firebase emulators:start`

This however, doesn't support authentication, as such the application requires a full firebase project/credentials.
